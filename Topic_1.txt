Tobacco is the common name of several plants in the genus Nicotiana of the family Solanaceae, and the general term for any product prepared from the cured leaves of these plants. 
More than 70 species of tobacco are known, but the chief commercial crop is Nicotiana tabacum. The more potent variant Nicotiana rustica is also used in some countries. Dried- 
tobacco leaves are mainly used for smoking in cigarettes and cigars, as well as pipes and shishas. They can also be consumed as snuff, chewing tobacco, dipping tobacco, and snus. 
Tobacco contains the highly addictive stimulant alkaloid nicotine as well as harmala alkaloids.[1] Tobacco use is a cause or risk factor for many deadly diseases, especially those 
affecting the heart, liver, and lungs, as well as many cancers. In 2008, the World Health Organization named tobacco use as the world's single greatest preventable cause of death.

𝐇𝐞𝐚𝐭-𝐧𝐨𝐭-𝐛𝐮𝐫𝐧 𝐭𝐨𝐛𝐚𝐜𝐜𝐨 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐬 (𝐍𝐨𝐧-𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐛𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐜𝐢𝐠𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐬)
The IQOS was introduced in June 2014 by Philip Morris.The IQOS is an electronic device, touted as a "heat-not-burn" product. 
Heat-not-burn tobacco products heat tobacco and produce an inhalable aerosol, instead of burning tobacco like traditional cigarettes. Heat-not-burn products use real tobacco, 
not the flavored liquid nicotine typically found in e-cigarettes. "Heatsticks," which look like mini cigarettes, are inserted inside.

𝐒𝐦𝐨𝐤𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐭𝐨𝐛𝐚𝐜𝐜𝐨 (𝐂𝐡𝐞𝐰𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐨𝐛𝐚𝐜𝐜𝐨, 𝐬𝐜𝐫𝐚𝐩, 𝐩𝐥𝐮𝐠, 𝐬𝐩𝐢𝐭 𝐭𝐨𝐛𝐚𝐜𝐜𝐨, 𝐝𝐢𝐩𝐩𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐨𝐛𝐚𝐜𝐜𝐨, 𝐬𝐧𝐮𝐟𝐟, 𝐬𝐧𝐮𝐬)
Spit tobacco and snuff are readily available throughout Michigan in candy flavors including mint, cinnamon, apple, berry, citrus, cherry, and peach. Snus, a moist form of smokeless tobacco, 
typically is offered in small pouches similar to tea bags and is held in the mouth, either behind the upper lip or between the cheek or teeth and the gums. First developed in Sweden, snus 
are a "spit-free" form of tobacco and have been marketed aggressively in the United States as an alternative nicotine-delivery system in smoke-free environments. American snus are available 
in a variety of flavors, including spearmint, wintergreen, vanilla, and various fruits.

𝐇𝐨𝐨𝐤𝐚𝐡 (𝐖𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐩𝐢𝐩𝐞, 𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐬𝐡𝐚, 𝐧𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐡𝐢𝐥𝐞, 𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐡, 𝐡𝐮𝐛𝐛𝐥𝐞-𝐛𝐮𝐛𝐛𝐥𝐞)
Hookah smoking involves using a water pipe or shisha to pass tobacco smoke through water or a distilled alcoholic beverage, such as vodka, before it is inhaled. Different flavors, such as apple, 
mint, cherry, chocolate, coconut, licorice, cappuccino, and watermelon, are available. In an hour-long hookah session, a smoker can inhale 100-200 times the volume of smoke inhaled from a single 
cigarette. The charcoal used to heat the shisha also can increase health risks by exposing the user to high levels of carbon monoxide, metals, and cancer-causing chemicals and by exposing both 
users and non-users to the carcinogens in secondhand smoke that remains in the area.

𝐂𝐢𝐠𝐚𝐫𝐬 (𝐂𝐢𝐠𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐨𝐬, 𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐭𝐥𝐞 𝐜𝐢𝐠𝐚𝐫𝐬, 𝐥𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞 𝐜𝐢𝐠𝐚𝐫𝐬)
Large cigars, cigarillos, and little cigars are readily available, come in a vast array of fruit and candy flavors, and are sold individually, often for as little as 25 cents each.  All those 
factors can make them attractive to youth. Large cigars, which do not include a filter, can deliver as much as 10 times the nicotine, twice the tar, and more than five times the carbon monoxide 
than a filtered cigarette. Cigarillos, which are three to four inches long and more narrow, may or may not include a filter. Little cigars, which are about the size of a cigarette, typically do have a filter.

𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐬𝐨𝐥𝐯𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐬 
Dissolvable products are made either of nicotine gel, such as Nicospan, or of finely ground tobacco pressed into lozenges, sticks, strips, orbs. They can look like candy or small mints and are 
marketed in a variety of flavors. The fact that they are made to dissolve slowly in the mouth means they are more easily concealed, because the user does not have to spit or dispose of any leftover 
portion of the product after use. Because they are used orally and involve swallowing tobacco juice, there is increased concern about the possibility of oral, esophageal and stomach cancers 
arising among long-term users.

𝐄-𝐜𝐢𝐠𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐬 (𝐕𝐚𝐩𝐞𝐬, 𝐯𝐚𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐳𝐞𝐫𝐬, 𝐡𝐨𝐨𝐤𝐚𝐡 𝐩𝐞𝐧𝐬, 𝐞-𝐡𝐨𝐨𝐤𝐚𝐡, 𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐢𝐜 𝐩𝐢𝐩𝐞𝐬, 𝐞-𝐩𝐢𝐩𝐞𝐬.)
E-cigarettes and other electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) are tobacco products that allow a user to inhale an aerosol containing nicotine and other substances. 
They are not FDA-approved quit-smoking devices.
