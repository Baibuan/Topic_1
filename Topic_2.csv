"Smoking leads to disease and disability and harms nearly every organ of the body."
"More than 16 million Americans are living with a disease caused by smoking. For every person who dies because of smoking, at least 30 people"
"live with a serious smoking-related illness. Smoking causes cancer, heart disease, stroke, lung diseases, diabetes, and chronic obstructive"
"pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Smoking also increases risk for tuberculosis, certain eye diseases,"
"and problems of the immune system, including rheumatoid arthritis."

"Secondhand smoke exposure contributes to approximately 41,000 deaths among nonsmoking adults and 400 deaths in infants each year. Secondhand"
"smoke causes stroke, lung cancer, and coronary heart disease in adults. Children who are exposed to secondhand smoke are at increased risk for"
"sudden infant death syndrome, acute respiratory infections, middle ear disease, more severe asthma, respiratory symptoms, and slowed lung growth."

"Smoking can cause cancer and then block your body from fighting it."
"- Poisons in cigarette smoke can weaken the body’s immune system, making it harder to kill cancer cells. When this happens, cancer cells keep"
"growing without being stopped."
"- Poisons in tobacco smoke can damage or change a cell’s DNA. DNA is the cell’s “instruction manual” that controls a cell’s normal growth and"
"function. When DNA is damaged, a cell can begin growing out of control and create a cancer tumor."
""
"Doctors have known for years that smoking causes most lung cancers. It’s still true today, when nearly 9 out of 10 lung cancers are caused by"
"smoking cigarettes. In fact, smokers have a greater risk for lung cancer today than they did in 1964, even though they smoke fewer cigarettes."
"One reason may be changes in how cigarettes are made and what chemicals they contain."

"Smoking is a major cause of CVD and causes one of every four deaths from CVD. Smoking can:"
""
"- Raise triglycerides (a type of fat in your blood)"
"- Lower “good” cholesterol (HDL)"
"- Make blood sticky and more likely to clot, which can block blood flow to the heart and brain"
"- Damage cells that line the blood vessels"
"- Increase the buildup of plaque (fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances) in blood vessels"
"- Cause thickening and narrowing of blood vessels"

"- Mothers who smoke are more likely to deliver their babies early. Preterm delivery is a leading cause of death, disability, and disease among newborns."
"- One in every five babies born to mothers who smoke during pregnancy has low birth weight. Mothers who are exposed to secondhand smoke while pregnant"
"are more likely to have lower birth weight babies. Babies born too small or too early are not as healthy."
"- Both babies whose mothers smoke while pregnant and babies who are exposed to secondhand smoke after birth are more likely to die from sudden infant"
"death syndrome (SIDS) than babies who are not exposed to cigarette smoke. Babies whose mothers smoke are about three times more likely to die from SIDS."
"- Babies whose mothers smoke while pregnant or who are exposed to secondhand smoke after birth have weaker lungs than other babies, which increases"
"the risk for many health problems."

"There is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke; even brief exposure can cause serious health problems. Secondhand smoke can cause coronary heart disease,"
"stroke, and lung cancer in adults who do not smoke. Because their bodies are still growing, infants and young children are especially impacted by health problems"
"caused by secondhand smoke. Children exposed to secondhand smoke are at an increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), acute respiratory infections"
"such as pneumonia and bronchitis, middle ear disease, more frequent and severe asthma, respiratory symptoms, and slowed lung growth."
""
"Most people are exposed to secondhand smoke in their homes or their places of work. People may also be exposed to secondhand smoke in public places like bars,"
"restaurants, and casinos. People are more likely to be exposed to secondhand smoke if they live in multi-unit housing—like apartment buildings with many homes"
"next to one another in the same place. Even when no one in the home smokes, secondhand smoke can drift from other units including via hallways, stairwells, and"
"ventilation systems."
""
"Eliminating smoking is the only way to fully protect people from secondhand smoke exposure. The harm caused by secondhand smoke is preventable. Comprehensive"
"smokefree laws and policies that prohibit smoking in all areas of indoor spaces are the only way to fully protect people who do not smoke from secondhand smoke exposure."
"Comprehensive smokefree laws and policies can also help people quit smoking and can help keep young people from starting to smoke. These laws and policies must be applied"
"equitably to ensure all people have a fair and just opportunity to breathe smokefree air and be as healthy as possible."
