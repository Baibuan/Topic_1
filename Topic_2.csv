"Smoking leads to disease and disability and harms nearly every organ of the body."
"More than 16 million Americans are living with a disease caused by smoking. For every person who dies because of smoking, at least 30 people"
"live with a serious smoking-related illness. Smoking causes cancer, heart disease, stroke, lung diseases, diabetes, and chronic obstructive"
"pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Smoking also increases risk for tuberculosis, certain eye diseases,"
"and problems of the immune system, including rheumatoid arthritis."
